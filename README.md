Question and Answering sites like Yahoo and Google Answers existed over a decade
however they failed to keep up the content value of their topics and answers due to a lot
of junk informa- tion posted; thus their user base declined. On the other hand, Quora is
an emerging site for the quality content, launched in 2009 and as of 2019, it is estimated
to have 300 million active users1. Quora has 400,000 unique topics2 and domain experts
as its user so that the users get the first-hand information from the experts in the field.
With the advancing repository of the knowledge base, there is a need for Quora to
preserve the belief of the users, maintain the content quality, by discarding the junk,
duplicate and insincere information. Quora has successfully prevail over this challenge
by organizing the data effectively by using modern data science approach to eliminate
question duplication.
As reported by Quora there has been many duplicate questions asked by users which
actually means the same thing and creates a confusion as people has answered to the
same question in different locations . For the instance , suppose take these two questions-
“How old are you ? ”&“What is your birthday?”. Although these questions have no
word in common but have the same intent.Hence, Quora would like to group these
similar questions together so that all the answers could be presented at the same place
and a better user experience overall. We have used the dataset provided by Quora to
create a model which can identify duplicate questions posted by the users.
We need to create a machine learning software to understand that specific language,
there are plenty of NLP machine learning tutorials out there.Once we have an NLP
understanding software you can then run through all the questions and push the output
data to another machine learning software, One that can identify contextual similarity
patterns from your data.
